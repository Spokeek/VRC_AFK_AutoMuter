# VRC AFK AutoMuter

## Description

This is an OSC tool that automatically mutes when AFK in VRChat.

## References

This project only exists thanks to the previous work of [Sayamame-beans](https://github.com/Sayamame-beans) on their own project at <https://github.com/Sayamame-beans/VRC_AFK_AutoMuter>

If you need a dedicated app instead of a VRC OSC Integration, go check out their project.

## Integration

This project is developped as a module for VRC_OSC project, an aggregator of OSC projects to be run easily from one place.

Please refer to the project page <https://github.com/VolcanicArts/VRCOSC> to install the application.

For now the app needs to be added manually but my be available from the app list in the future.

## Manual installation

Please dowload the latest build from the release page and add the file to the VRC OSC Data folder `%appdata%\Roaming\VRCOSC\assemblies` (after installing VRCOSC of course)

## Manual Build / Modification

This project is under MIT Liscence, so you can always modify it yourself, but try to refer to previous creators work if needed.

The project is configured to add the binary after a local build, so no need do extra work on that part.

## Feedback

If you have some feedback or require some additional features on that, feel free to create issues or suggest modifications through PRs.
